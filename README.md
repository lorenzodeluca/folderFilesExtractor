# folderFilesExtractor
tool that extracts files from a folder and all its subfolders and renames them based on the last modification date.  A use case is to rename files in a more user-friendly way after recovery from a hard drive with a corrupted file system, for example after a file extraction with photorec(https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download).
